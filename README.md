## FAQ

### 1. How do I contribute?

Currently, my biggest **need is for an experienced gameplay developer**. If you are not interested in contributing directly, I would be happy just to use you as a mentor. I have been an engineer for well over a decade, but haven't worked on games since college.

That said, anyone is welcome to share their skills or ideas. Just shoot me an email at adasgames0@gmail.com. 

### 2. Where can I track project status?

I do not currently have a Trello board or similar project tracking mechanism. If enough people become interested in the probject, however, I will happily set one up.

### 2. What kind of game will this be?

My current goal is to keep the game as similar to the first as possible and enhance it with quality of life improvements and modding tools. That said, the original Rebellion had some deeply obtuse mechanics that will likely require significant mental gymnastics to replicate. I believe that was the reason why very little of the original made it into its spiritual successor, Empire at War. So we will see what happens.

### 3. When will this be complete?

I work as a manager at a FAANG company. Unless I am joined by additional contributors, the ebbs and flows of commercial software development are likely to push this project into multiple hiatuses. It honestly may never be completed.

### 4. Will Disney permit this?

I have absolutely *zero* desire to step on Disney's toes here. I have built a lot of seriously awesome stuff for Disney over the years and have no desire to harm our working relationship. My ultimate hope is that I can produce enough to entice Disney into bringing this project in-house (even if that means closing the game's source code, which they would almost certainly require). Should they ask me to de-Rebellion the game, however, I will do so without hesitation and build something entirely different.
